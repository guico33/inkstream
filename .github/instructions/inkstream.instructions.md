The application is a full-stack serverless web app on AWS. It allows users to upload images or PDFs (stored in S3), then automatically processes them: first extracting text via Amazon Textract, then using an LLM (Anthropicâ€™s Claude 3 Haiku on Amazon Bedrock) to reformat/translate the text, and finally (optionally) converting the text to speech via Amazon Polly. The frontend is a React-based SPA; the backend is entirely serverless (API Gateway + AWS Lambda) with workflow orchestration via AWS Step Functions. User authentication is handled by Amazon Cognito (federated with Google). We use DynamoDB to track users and file metadata, and S3 for file storage. Infrastructure is defined in code (AWS CDK chosen) and development is done in a monorepo for best code sharing and CI integration.
